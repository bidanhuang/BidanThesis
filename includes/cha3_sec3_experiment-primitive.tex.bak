\section{Experiments of planning grasps for familiar objects}
\label{cha3:sec3}

This section presents a few results of our method (Figure~\ref{contour},~\ref{icub_cuboid}\footnote{The small penetrations and gaps between the fingers and the object are caused by two factors, (1) that the width of the fingers are not taken into account in the optimization and (2) the variance of the results. A supplemental implementation will be applied on the real scenario to handle the variances.},~\ref{barrett}). As mentioned above, grasps of the iCub hand are described in 14 dimensions: hand position (3D), hand orientation (3D in Euler angle), finger joint angles (8D), and grasps of the Barrett hand are described in 8 dimensions: hand position (3D), hand orientation (4D in axis-angle representation), finger separation angle (1D). Six different objects are presented here: cylinder, cuboid, ashtray, shoe, joystick and airplane model. For each object, three different initial postures and their final grasps are shown. Figure~\ref{contour} shows the results of iCub grasping a cylinder, and the corresponding projections from the initial query points to the model. The results of the cylinder and cuboid show that a variety of grasps can be obtained for simple shapes to satisfy different task requirements. The ashtray, airplane model and joystick shapes are chosen from the GraspIt! object library, showing the method indeed works with complex shapes. In some figures the wrist may seem to rotate over 360 degrees to reach the final grasps from the initial pose. This is because the path planning of the arm is not taken into account in our approach. In terms of the hand orientation solely, a much smaller rotation is needed to go from the initial pose to the final grasp.

To test the computation time we generated 3000 random initial query points for each grasping task. The initial query points are placed at different distances away from the object surface, varying between 3$cm$ to 50$cm$, and the hand orientation is random. The initial finger configuration is not taken into account in finding the feasible region and hence it is set to the robot hand starting values. The computation time and experimental details are shown in Table~\ref{result}.

%The table also shows the success rate of finding good grasps in each task. By success it means a force-closure and feasible grasp, i.e. the grasp must satisfy all the criteria described in Section 3A, is found within an acceptable variance.
%For the iCub, all the kinematic constraints: if an optimal solution is found under these constraints and the difference between the solution and the initial condition can be eliminated solely by the supplemental implementation, the result is considered to be success. For the Barrett hand, each result is supplied to the GraspIt! grasp planner and if the grasp quality is larger than zero, i.e. force-closure, it is regarded as success.

%The table also shows the success rate of finding good grasps, i.e. the grasps that satisfy all the kinematic and force-closure criteria described in Section 3A within an acceptable variance. A supplemental implementation is applied here to handle the variance: the fingers will continue to clutch until contact is made; if they contact the object surface before reaching the expected finger configuration, they will halt to avoid penetration.
%For the iCub hand a result is considered to be successful when it satisfies the kinematic and force-closure criteria. For the Barrett hand, a result is considered to be successful when its grasp quality is larger than zero, i.e. force-closure.
Table~\ref{result} also shows the success rate of generated grasps with the iCub and the Barrett hands. A grasp is considered to be successful if it satisfies the force-closure criterion, is feasible for the hand kinematics and is not in collision with the object (see Section 3A). When executing the obtained grasp, the fingers will continue to clutch until contact is made; if they contact the object surface before reaching the expected finger configuration, they will halt to avoid penetration.
All the results shown in Figure~\ref{contour},~\ref{icub_cuboid},~\ref{barrett} are good grasps.

As can be seen from Table~\ref{result}, the success rate depends on the dimensions of the grasp space and the surface geometry of the target objects. Grasps in lower degrees of freedom (the Barrett hand) have higher success rates than those in higher degrees of freedom (the iCub hand). This suggests that the higher dimension grasp space is more complex than the lower dimension grasp space and needs more data to represent the full complexity. On the other hand, objects with smooth surfaces have a success rate around 90\%. Objects with a couple of prominences have success rates over 85\% as the configuration space of grasping is discontinuous. In the Barrett hand and airplane model task, the failed grasps are concentrated on two places: the thin edges of the wings and the propeller. Grasping these places requires high accuracy and more training data on these parts would be needed.
%At the other hand, objects with smooth surface have a high rate of success. Objects with a couple of prominence have success rate about 85\% as the configuration space of grasping is discontinue. In the Barrett hand and airplane model task, the failure grasps are concentrated on two places: the thin edges of the wings and the propeller. Grasping these two places require high accuracy and this is not the main concern of this paper.

To compare with the training data, we compute the grasp quality of the results with the same metrics we used in data generation. The mean of the grasp quality of the training set and the result set are similar, though the result set has slightly higher value in most of cases. We are able to find some grasps of higher quality than all grasps in the training set (Figure~\ref{near}). This shows that GMM is able to model and generalize the high dimensional grasp space, especially for objects with smooth surfaces.

% For the iCub hand, 612 different feasible grasps of a cylindrical object are obtained by the optimization~\cite{sahar2012}. The learned GMM model has 40 Gaussian components, determined by BIC, and each Gaussian has 14 dimensions: hand position (3D), hand orientation (3D), finger joint angles (8D).
