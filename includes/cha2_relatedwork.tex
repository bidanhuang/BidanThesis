This chapter gives an overview of the relative research areas: robot grasping and manipulation, imitation learning and modular approaches. In Section \ref{cha2:sec1:grasping} we overview the studies in robot grasping and manipulation, outline the current challenges in the area. In Section \ref{cha2:sec2:learning}, we introduce the technique of robot imitation learning (program by demonstration) and particularly look at its applications in robot grasping and manipulation. In Section \ref{cha2:sec3:modular} we first discuss the motivation of modular approaches and its biological inspiration. We then give a brief review on modular approaches in control theory (multiple module adaptive control). The final part of this section focus on the applications of modular approaches in robotics, especially in grasping and manipulation. Figure \ref{fig:litreview} depict the structure of this section.
