The modular approach is an effective way to simply the design of complex system. It is used both in natural intelligence and software engineering.

The modularity we study is the ``task level'', which concentrate on the modularity appear in individual tasks. Its main idea is to simply the programming of robots and provide an end-user level interface to teach robot to do tasks. A future work is to study the ``super-task level'' modularity, i.e. to group the tasks can share same modules together and build modules for them. Eventually, a hierarchy structure of modules will be build. Learn a bank of modules.

Offline learning -> online learning. Identify new task and increase number of modules.

modularization can be done by language. 

a framework to do all the modularization: extract, model, choose, sequence, spacial combination, mix
